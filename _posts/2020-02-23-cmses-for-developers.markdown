I probably compiled this list when Ghost v2 came out and I had to start using markdown "cards" (a la Wordpress). Not sure where I gathered this list from. Could be worth a look ...

* http://wardrobecms.com/ - doesn't look like its available yet
* http://logdown.com/ - the missing blogging platform for hackers. By the look of the [hot this week](https://logdown.com/explore/week) list, there is a lot of people publishing about Trump on this platform. Maybe not this one.
* https://www.silvrback.com/ and this post: https://dsowers.silvrback.com/introducing-silvrback. All STEM writers feel the good vibe. Lots of messages re a 14 day trial. Hmmm
* http://codrspace.com/ - wat no HTTPS ?? Looks dead now anyway ..
