In the beginning. At one point I started thinking about the different email addresses I'd had along the years.

- ma1019@bris.ac.uk (1991 to 1995) - my first email address at Bristol University. I was in the Maths department, hence the 'ma' prefix. 
- clairefurney@hotmail.com (1995 to 1998) - I got a free hotmail address like a lot of people around this time, which gradually attracted more and more spam
- clairefurney@postmark.net (1998 to 2003) - swapped the hotmail for another free email provider with slightly better kudos and slighly less spam
- clairefurney@pipex.dsl.net (2003 to 2005) - from the broadband provider who supplied the flat in Fulham
- clairefurney@thenewhotmail.com (2005 to date) - never looked back
