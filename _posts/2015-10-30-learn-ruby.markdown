1. Reinstall Mac with OS X El Capitan
2. Set up Mac including `rbenv` etc (make note of steps)
3. Why's Poignant Guide, potentially interspersed with Ruby Koans
4. Ruby Koans
5. Hartl's Rails Tutorial

### Reinstall Mac with OSX El Capitan

All files synced with Dropbox, all photos synced with Box, clean up other downloads etc and save off anything else to keep to NAS.

### Set up Mac

Using KitchenPlan? Overkill?

### Ruby Koans

Simply a set of unit test files which are executed in a certain order and initially all fail. The unit test runner directs you to which file to fix next. 

Ensure you have ruby, download the zip file of koans from http://rubykoans.com/ and run `ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb` inside the directory to execute the test runner.

34 files in total consisting of 282 tests.
