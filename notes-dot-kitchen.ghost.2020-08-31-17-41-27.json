I was living in Japan at the time and wanted a way to catch up on the odd UK TV program. Eventually development discontinued and support stopped. The program was still available and worked fine, but I’ve never got excited about using something that isn’t getting constantly updated. I couldn’t find another usenet program I liked and I’d moved back to the UK, so I gave up Easynews and fell back on my free Teranews account whilst continuing a half hearted search.\\n\\nThen I found usenet indexing sites. And newzbin.com. And SABnzbd. The simplicity compared to the old way of downloading headers for a group, searching through, downloading headers for the next group etc was incredible. It was time to start paying for a premium usenet account again.\\n\\nGiganews is great. Loads of retention, no problem with server speeds. If I use all my allocation in one month, then the next month just starts early. I was very happy. Until today.\\n\\nI’m back in Japan, and back to wanting to download some UK TV. I soon started to reach my 10GB monthly limit and wanted a more permanent solution. So I upgraded to the Diamond account which came with [VPN access](http://www.giganews.com/vyprvpn/) (not UK though), unlimited downloads and a usenet browser to browse the whole of giganews 3+years of retention. I had half an idea that they would soon be introducing a UK VPN server, so I’d be able to use BBC iPlayer as well as having secure browsing if I needed it.  There was an offer of half price for the first month. And I could see that prices for the service would be increasing in January, but I could get and keep the old price if I signed up now.\\n\\nI signed up, the [Mimo](http://www.giganews.com/mimo/) usenet browser was pants, not having a UK VPN server was a problem, and there were no reports of having one on the horizon (despite there appearing to have been one at one point).  So I signed up with [StrongVPN](http://strongvpn.com/) for VPN access ([awesome VPN, rubbish customer support](http://strongvpn.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=690)) and today went to downgrade my account back to Bronze.\\n\\nWhen I noticed that where in the past I’d been paying $7.99 a month for the service, it had now gone up to $9.99.  Quick google later, and indeed their prices had gone up in November, but existing customers remained on the rate they always had paid. Since I’d just messed around upgrading and downgrading, however, I didn’t get to keep my previous rate and had to start paying the new rate. Another quick google and [astraweb](http://www.news.astraweb.com/index.html) was a popular alternative with a similar plan for $9.99 a month, but with 25GB download limit and retention in the same ball park.

But when I lost my card, they\ncontinued to try charging my old card every single day until I was able to\nupdate my card details. When the payment finally succeeded this triggered one of\nmy bank’s anti-fraud systems resulting in a phone call to my bank to sort that\nout. It looked like that situation was resolved until the next month when my\ncard got rejected again. Phone calls to my bank. No record of rejecting payment.\nWent round in circles for a while before realising that Webfaction use PayPal\nfor their payments (not branded as PayPal, but it does say clearly in their\nblurb) and my payment was actually being rejected by PayPal because my PayPal\naccount was limited.\n\nSorted this out with WebFaction and all kudos to them for their helpful and\nresponsive customer support, but led to realising I’m paying too much for\nhosting I don’t use enough.\n\n123 Systems - antiknowledge base\nSo I got a 256MB/10GB/500GB Linux VPS from 123Systems Solutions\n[http://123systems.net] for $19 a year through a promotion on Low End Box\n[http://www.lowendbox.com]. And now I have a login to a box which so far does\nnothing, and a very sparse looking control panel.\n\nThe sign up form gave me the opportunity to have webmin installed, so will go\nlooking for that. I know I only have 1 IP Address so I won’t be able to run my\nown name servers. Probably don’t have enough RAM anyway. Can’t find anything in\n123Systems knowledge base about setting up with their web servers except:\n\n> With Kloxo you can chose to run your own nameservers, which enable you to have\ncustom DNS records like “ns1 and ns2.mydomain.com” or you can use the DNS\nservers we provide for VPS customers.\n\n\nThough I am led to believe from someone else that their knowledge base has been\ncopied and pasted from some other hosting company, confirmed by this bit:\n\n> If you want to stick with the HyperVM option please see the DNS instructions in\nthe following document:\n\n\nbut no link given.

Setting port 80 with HTTPS didn't appear\nto work for the octopus portal at least (and is confusing at best).\n\nProposal\nDo in the initial handshake 'manually' and only require the server comms port to\nbe open (and use port 443 for this - which requires the octopus web portal to\nrun on some other port e.g. 8443).\n\nSolution\n 1. Register a new machine with Octopus using the REST api\n\n * Endpoint: https://octopus-server:port/api/machines\n * Headers: X-Octopus-ApiKey: API-JRIXL3O2GQBKWJE2FI1TKRFTGU\n * Payload: { \"EnvironmentIds\": [\"Environments-1\"], \"Endpoint\": {\n   \"CommunicationStyle\": \"TentacleActive\", \"Thumbprint\":\n   \"F9E49532BAC8772FE6B6A24D0A7671298EB015D4\",\n   \"Uri\":\"poll://6n7xkg92t8r3szf3zfk2/\" }, \"Name\":\"OCTOPUS\", \"Roles\":\n   [\"octopus-server\"], \"Thumbprint\":\"F9E49532BAC8772FE6B6A24D0A7671298EB015D4\" }\n\n 2. Note 1 the \"poll\" uri in the payload above is required but it appears that\n    any unique string will work. Note 2 get a list of all environments using \n    https://octopus-server:port/api/environments\n 3. The tentacle should now be registered on the server (though not yet\n    connectable)\n 4. Install the Tentacle\n 5. Run the following instance creation / configurations manually (replacing the\n    trust certificate thumbprint with the one from the server):\n\n * Tentacle.exe create-instance --instance \"Tentacle\" --config\n   \"D:\\Octopus\\Tentacle.config\"\n * Tentacle.exe new-certificate --instance \"Tentacle\" --if-blank\n * Tentacle.exe configure --instance \"Tentacle\" --reset-trust\n * Tentacle.exe configure --instance \"Tentacle\" --home \"D:\\Octopus\" --app\n   \"D:\\Octopus\\Applications\" --noListen \"True\"\n * Tentacle.exe configure --instance \"Tentacle\"\n   --trust=233E6B9580D15A9E90D23424A644025722A89A44\n * Tentacle.exe server-comms --style=TentacleActive --host=octopus-server\n   --port=443\n\n 6. Browse to the instance directory and update the subscriptionId from null to\n    the same poll uri used above\n 7. Start the tentacle\n 8. Run a \"check health\" to confirm registered successfully and all working","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-12-08T22:43:24.000Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T23:21:48.000Z","published_at":"2015-12-08T23:20:38.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5b47b1de687a04370d2e4125","uuid":"8d0a0e48-0125-4c3a-9dc3-63ef0486e739","title":"Geneaology","slug":"geneaology","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"### References \\n\\n* http://genealogy.about.com/library/lessons/blintro.htm\\n* http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rigenweb/abbrev.html\\n\\n### Basics\\nTry to record for each person\\n\\n* date and place of birth\\n* names of parents\\n* date and place of marriage\\n* names of children\\n* date and place of death\\n\\nAncestor\\n: A person from whom you are descended - parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents and so on. \\n\\nCollateral relationship\\n: Relationships between individuals who descend from common ancestors but are not related to each other in a direct (or lineal) line.

St. Michael,\n   Bristol, Glouchestershire, England\n\nSources and Citations\nhttp://genealogy.about.com/od/citing/a/sources.htm\n\n * Recording the full details of the source of any piece of information is \n   crucial\n * assist others in evaluating your research and let them know what your facts\n   are based on\n * provide a reference in cases where a newly found fact appears to conflict\n   with previous assumptions\n * help you go back to a previously used source when you have missed information\n   or found new details which lead to more information from that source\n\nSource Types\nOriginal vs Derivative\n: Referring to the provenance of a record, original sources contribute written,\noral or visual information not derived (copied, transcribed, summarised) from\nanother written or oral record\n\nPrimary vs Secondary\n: Within each source, whether original or derivative, primary information comes\nfrom records created at or near the time of the event from someone with close\nknowledge of the event. In contrast secondary information is from records\ncreated some time after the event, or from someone not present at the event.\n\nCitations\nGo from general to specific\n\n * Author - the one who authored the book, provided the interview, or wrote the\n   letter\n * Title - if it is an article, then the title of the article, followed by the\n   title of the periodical\n * Publication details - place of publication, name of publisher and date of\n   publication, written in parentheses (Place: Publisher, Date)\n   volume, issue and page numbers for periodicals\n   series and roll or item number for microfilm\n * Where you found it - repository name and location, website name and URL,\n   cemetery name and location, etc.\n * Specific details - page number, entry number and date, date you viewed a\n   website, etc.\n\nSite derivative sources properly by siting the index, website url, book or\ndatabase which you used and not the actual source from which the derivative\nsource was created (although this can be included as information about the\nderivative source)\n\nExamples\nBooks\n> Willis H.

A Sinatra application will be detected as such (by the existence of a Gemfile) and the default ruby build pack used. To run Bower on Heroku, you need to use node. So your app also needs to have node configuration files (the package.json) and you need to additionally add the node build pack. This seems frustrating since you won’t be using the node server part at all, but so far this seems to be the only way of doing things. \\n\\nA step by step guide follows.\\n\\n## Skeleton Sinatra app\\n\\n* Make a directory for your application and `cd` into it.\\n* Create a `Gemfile` for Sinatra with the following (update ruby version as required):\\n```\\nruby '2.3.0'\\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\\ngem 'sinatra'\\n```\\n* Run `bundler`\\n* Create an `app.rb` for Sinatra\\n```\\nrequire 'sinatra'\\nget '/' do\\n    \\\"Hello World\\\"\\nend\\n```\\n* Create a `config.ru` to run Sinatra (required by Heroku)\\n```\\nrequire './app'\\nrun Sinatra::Application\\n```\\n\\n## Test Sinatra app\\n\\nTest everything works ok locally without bower.\\n\\n* Run `ruby app.rb` to start the server\\n* Browse to http://localhost:4567 to check the \\\"Hello World\\\" message is displayed\\n* Ctrl-C to stop the server\\n\\n## Add Bower (via Node)\\n\\n* Run `npm init` to initialise Node thereby creating the Node.js `package.json`. The defaults for everything will work fine (the entry point default of `index.js` is not important since we won’t be running the node server)\\n* Run `npm install bower --save` to install Bower locally. Using the `--save` flag ensures the `package.json` is updated to include Bower as a dependency. The `node_modules` directory will be created in the application root containing the bower binaries.\\n* Run `bower init` to initialise bower thereby creating the `bower.json` config file. Again, defaults for everything are fine. (If you don't have bower installed globally you'll need to use the local bower `node_modules/bower/bin/bower init`)\\n* By default Sinatra looks for static files in the `.public` directory. By default Bower installs all client side libraries to the `bower_components` directory. Either Sinatra, Bower or both need to be updated to ensure Sinatra serves these files correctly.\\n    - Update Sinatra to reference a different directory for static files e.g. `public` by adding the following line to the `app.rb`: `set :public_folder, File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/public'`\\n    - Update Bower to install dependencies to a different directory e.g. `public/lib` by adding a `.bowerrc` file with the following:\\n      `{ \\\"directory\\\": \\\"public/lib\\\" }`\\n* Install client side dependencies via Bower ensuring you add the flag to update the `bower.json` config file e.g. to install Bootstrap run `bower install bootstrap -save`\\n\\n## Add Bower dependency to Sinatra\\n\\nModify the Sinatra application to actually use something managed by Bower. The example here uses Bootstrap.\\n\\n* Update `app.rb` to serve a template file\\n\\n```\\nget '/' do\\n    content_type 'html'\\n    erb :index\\nend\\n```\\n* Add a `views` directory and an `index.erb` file\\n* Copy the Bootstrap starter template to the index.erb from http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template\\n* Update the urls to the bootstrap artefacts to reference the correct place e.g. `lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css`\\n\\n## Test Sinatra app (again)\\n\\nTest everything works ok locally with bower.\\n\\n* Run `ruby app.rb` to start the server\\n* Browse to http://localhost:4567 to check the template is displayed and the local browser is loading the bower dependencies without issues\\n* Ctrl-C to stop the server\\n\\n## Initialise git repo\\n\\n* Run `git init` to initialise a repo\\n* Create a `.gitignore` file with the `node_modules` folder and `public` folder listed\\n* Run `git add .` to add all files\\n* Run `git commit -m 'Initial commit'`\\n\\n## Configure and push to Heroku\\n\\n* Run `heroku create` to initialise heroku for this application\\n* Run `git push heroku master` to push source and build\\n* There should be a message that only one build pack was used, most likely ruby. Check this using `heroku buildpacks`. To add the nodejs build pack use `heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs`. This will add the build pack in the first position. Ruby needs to be in the last position to actually run the app. (See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app for reference.)\\n* Push again to trigger another build, this time with both build packs.\\n* Bower will not have been triggered, so finally update package.json to run this by adding: \\n\\n```\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"postinstall\\\": \\\"./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install\\\"\\n  },\\n```\\n* Commit, push and bower should now be triggered\\n* `heroku open` to test the deployed application is working\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href=\"http://www.sinatrarb.com/\">Sinatra</a> is a lightweight web framework using Ruby which is easy to get up and running quickly, particularly if you don’t need the models and data persistence part.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bower.io/\">Bower</a> is the de facto way to manage client side dependencies such as <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> and <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\">Heroku</a> is an app hosting service which integrates well with <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">git</a> and the command line.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usenodejstorunbower\">Use Node.js to run Bower</h3>\n<p>When you deploy your application to Heroku, it detects which kind of application you have by the existence of certain core files and builds it accordingly.

The actual server set up notes are here: https://docs.ghost.org/v1.0.0/docs/install. These take off after spinning up the new server.\\n\\n### Provision Ubuntu 16.04 server\\n\\n1. Log into the Azure portal and choose an appropriate image. Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS published by Canonical is the only 16.04 offering currently, select the image, select Resource Manager and Create.\\n2. Enter a name for the server, a username and paste in your public key `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`\\n3. [Choose a size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general). Since I don't use this much, I went for a \\\"Burstable VM\\\" size B2S Standard for £14.97 a month pro rata (later configured to spin down each night to stay within the Visual Studio subscription free credit rules viz no production servers).\\n4. Default settings should be fine, configuring Auto-shutdown for 3 am and turning off boot diagnostics\\n5. Accept T&Cs and start the provisioning\\n6. Will take approx 5-10 mins to provision the new VM\\n\\n### Login\\n\\n1. SSH in via the public IP address: `ssh claire@13.81.108.220`\\n\\n### Setup server and install Ghost\\n\\n1. The user specified when creating the VM should already have su privileges, so nothing to do for the first part of the ghost instructions\\n2. Run `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`\\n3. Follow the instructions to install Nginx, open the firewall, install MySQL, install node.js and install Ghost-CLI\\n4. Finally run the ghost installer using `ghost install`. There is a separate page of instructions to explain the various prompts at: https://docs.ghost.org/docs/cli-install#section-prompts (run `ghost setup` to rerun this part if nec). Generally accept the defaults unless there is a good reason not to (e.g. setting up SSL afterwards). \\n\\n### Test locally\\n\\n1. `wget http://localhost:2368` on the server itself should successfully retrieve the index.html page\\n\\n### Set up for external access\\n\\nNginx was configured in the ghost install to proxy requests from localhost:2368 to your chosen domain, but this won't be accessible until the DNS is pointing at the correct IP address and Azure is configured to allow requests through.\\n\\n1. Update DNS records at your domain provider\\n2. While this is taking effect, add an entry to your local hosts file to test access e.g. to `/etc/hosts` (remove it later)\\n3. All Azure VMs created via the GUI are created with a Public IP and a Network Security Group. The Network Security Group controls access to the subnet your VM is provisioned within. To allow access from the internet to port 80 or port 443 (which Nginx is proxying the requests to Ghost on), add an inbound security rule on the NSG for port 443 (and port 80 if yet to configure SSL).\\n4. Test access e.g. http://notes.dot.kitchen\\n5. After the DNS propagation has taken effect run `ghost config url [your-ghost-url]` and then `ghost setup ssl` to configure a free Let's Encrypt certificate for your domain and configure Nginx to proxy the ghost install over port 443 instead\\n6. Test access e.g. https://notes.dot.kitchen\\n\\n### Configure admin\\n\\n1. Access the admin panel at [your-ghost-url]/ghost/\\n2. Enter an admin username and password\\n\\n### Import previous content\\n\\nIf you've screwed up a previous upgrade like me, head over to the labs page and reimport your .json backup file.

Every time I upgrade I seem\nto come a cropper, so here are my notes on spinning up a new server on Azure and\ngetting Ghost installed and set up using a custom domain over HTTPS.\n\nThe current hosting notes are here: https://docs.ghost.org/v1.0.0/docs/hosting \nand recommend Ubuntu 16.04. The actual server set up notes are here: \nhttps://docs.ghost.org/v1.0.0/docs/install. These take off after spinning up the\nnew server.\n\nProvision Ubuntu 16.04 server\n 1. Log into the Azure portal and choose an appropriate image. Ubuntu Server\n    16.04 LTS published by Canonical is the only 16.04 offering currently,\n    select the image, select Resource Manager and Create.\n 2. Enter a name for the server, a username and paste in your public key pbcopy\n    < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n 3. Choose a size\n    [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general]\n    . Since I don't use this much, I went for a \"Burstable VM\" size B2S Standard\n    for £14.97 a month pro rata (later configured to spin down each night to\n    stay within the Visual Studio subscription free credit rules viz no\n    production servers).\n 4. Default settings should be fine, configuring Auto-shutdown for 3 am and\n    turning off boot diagnostics\n 5. Accept T&Cs and start the provisioning\n 6. Will take approx 5-10 mins to provision the new VM\n\nLogin\n 1. SSH in via the public IP address: ssh claire@13.81.108.220\n\nSetup server and install Ghost\n 1. The user specified when creating the VM should already have su privileges,\n    so nothing to do for the first part of the ghost instructions\n 2. Run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade\n 3. Follow the instructions to install Nginx, open the firewall, install MySQL,\n    install node.js and install Ghost-CLI\n 4. Finally run the ghost installer using ghost install. There is a separate\n    page of instructions to explain the various prompts at: \n    https://docs.ghost.org/docs/cli-install#section-prompts (run ghost setup to\n    rerun this part if nec). Generally accept the defaults unless there is a\n    good reason not to (e.g. setting up SSL afterwards).\n\nTest locally\n 1. wget http://localhost:2368 on the server itself should successfully retrieve\n    the index.html page\n\nSet up for external access\nNginx was configured in the ghost install to proxy requests from localhost:2368\nto your chosen domain, but this won't be accessible until the DNS is pointing at\nthe correct IP address and Azure is configured to allow requests through.\n\n 1. Update DNS records at your domain provider\n 2. While this is taking effect, add an entry to your local hosts file to test\n    access e.g. to /etc/hosts (remove it later)\n 3. All Azure VMs created via the GUI are created with a Public IP and a Network\n    Security Group. The Network Security Group controls access to the subnet\n    your VM is provisioned within. To allow access from the internet to port 80\n    or port 443 (which Nginx is proxying the requests to Ghost on), add an\n    inbound security rule on the NSG for port 443 (and port 80 if yet to\n    configure SSL).\n 4. Test access e.g. http://notes.dot.kitchen\n 5. After the DNS propagation has taken effect run ghost config url\n    [your-ghost-url] and then ghost setup ssl to configure a free Let's Encrypt\n    certificate for your domain and configure Nginx to proxy the ghost install\n    over port 443 instead\n 6. Test access e.g. https://notes.dot.kitchen\n\nConfigure admin\n 1. Access the admin panel at [your-ghost-url]/ghost/\n 2. Enter an admin username and password\n\nImport previous content\nIf you've screwed up a previous upgrade like me, head over to the labs page and\nreimport your .json backup file. If you changed the default theme or had images\nin the content folder, time to sort this out now too.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-12-29T13:18:12.000Z","updated_at":"2017-12-29T13:33:00.000Z","published_at":"2017-12-29T13:26:31.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5b47b1de687a04370d2e4139","uuid":"b5c30a4b-e3aa-40cb-ac3c-604d1d12485d","title":"Scraping GRO search results using AngleSharp","slug":"scraping-the-gro","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Python has [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [lxml](http://lxml.de/).

The options are:\\n\\n* [HtmlAgilityPack](http://html-agility-pack.net/?z=codeplex) - this is possibly the most established library for parsing HTML, though appears to now be under new ownership. The new website seems a bit sparse on details (and a bit broken).

Last updated over 18 months ago, precious little documentation.\\n* [IronWebScraper](http://ironsoftware.com/csharp/webscraper/) - this looked promising, though again very little \\\"getting started\\\" type information, just the source code generated documentation.

The information available is great, but searching is slightly frustrating since you have to specify the gender and can only search within a five year range at a time.
